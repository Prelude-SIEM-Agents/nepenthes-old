Version 0.1.6
=============


We made sure the source compiles on
  * cygwin
  * linux (tested debian on x86, fedora core 3 on amd64, suse 9 enterprise server on powerpc)
  * openbsd (tested on openbsd 3.8 on x86)
  * netbsd (tested on netbsd 2.0.2 on x86)

For cygwin we had to cast many int32_t to int, and many int32_t * to int too (104 times)... and include sys/socket.h (26 times)
OpenBSD enforced including sys/types.h nearly everywhere (37 times)
64bit fedora made us use intptr_t instead of int to point to memory (19 times)

The other focus was adding some new shellcode handlers, 
and we added a new download handler for the broken by design rcp protocol
